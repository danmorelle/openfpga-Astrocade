#   general[0]  clk_sys     14.318182 MHz
#   general[1]  clk_sys_90  14.318182 MHz, 90 degrees (APF video only)

# clk_74a <-> clk_sys crossings all go through synchronisers, or (the
# BIOS and cartridge RAMs and their sizes) are only read while the bridge
# side is idle, so the domains are treated as asynchronous.
